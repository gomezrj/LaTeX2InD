LaTeX2InD
================

The Mac version is in EXPERIMENTAL STAGE. Currently, there are two versions:

LaTeX2InD_v1: relies on a .command execution as the original logic in Windows. This will most surely work, although it leaves a Terminal window open.

LaTeX2InD_v2: relies on a simple applescript but requires that /Library/Tex/texbin is an alias to where the latex compilers are stored. This should always be the case in principle.

BOTH VERSIONS REQUIRE A LOCAL INSTALLATION OF MACTEX!
